They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

They treated Cinderella very bad and did not appreciate her. Near from her home, there was a king’s palace which was so beautiful and there would be held a big party. Her stepmother and her sisters were invited to attend the party. However, they did not allow her to go to the party. She was ordered to sew the party dresses that would be worn by her mother and sisters. While, she did not have time to sew her dress. Her mother and her sisters went to a party and left Cinderella alone at home.<br /><br /> She felt very sad and cried. Between her tears, suddenly a fairy godmother appeared and said “do not cry, I can send you to the ball now!”, But she kept crying and looked so sad. She said, “I do not have a dress to wear in the ball”. The fairy godmother of course would not be worry and waved the wand to transform the Cinderella’s old clothes into the new dress which was very beautiful. Furthermore, that fairy godmother touched Cinderella’s foot with the ​​wand and suddenly Cinderella had beautiful glass slippers. Cinderella was shocked and said, “wow, thank you, but how I could go to the ball?”. Fairy godmother then went into the kitchen and saw four rats. She turned it into golden four horses and into a beautiful buggy. Before leaving home, the Fairy Godmother said “Cinderella, you have to go home at middle of the night, because this magic will works only until midnight!”<br /><br /> When Cinderella entered the palace, everyone was stunned by her beautiful face. In fact, no one recognized her because she was so different. Cinderella was so pretty with the dress and the glass slippers. A handsome prince also saw Cinderella and he fell in love. He met Cinderella and asked, “Do you want to dance?” And she said, “yes, I want to dance with you”. Prince and Cinderella danced during the night and she was so happy at that night. She forgot the fairy godmother warning that she should go home in the middle of the night. At the last moment, Cinderella remembered her promise to the fairy godmother and went home. “I must go!”, said her. She ran quickly and one of her glass slippers left but she did not come back to pick it up.<br /><br /> Cinderella arrived home a few minutes later. When she arrived, the clock struck in twelve.

Prince wanted to find out the identity of the girl, but he even did not know her name. Prince has only found the glass slipper, and he said, “I will find her, and I will marry the woman whose foot fits into this glass slipper!”.<br /><br /> In the next day, the prince and his bodyguards went to all the existing home. They wanted to find a woman whose foot matched with the size of the shoe. Cinderella stepsisters also tried the glass slipper but their feet do not match. When Cinderella wanted to try, her stepmother prevented and forbidden her. However, the prince said, “let her trying!”. When Cinderella wore a glass slipper, she had a perfect leg for the shoe. The prince then recognized her and he was convinced that she was a woman who danced with him at the dance. He married Cinderella and they lived happily.<br />

                        A lion was getting fed up of hunting. He called all animals and passed an order, "Everyday one of you should come by yourself as my prey". All animals started to obey this order. <br /><br />It was the hare's day. The hare was very sad. As he was going to the lion's den, he came across an old well. He looked into it. It was very deep and dangerous. He made a plan to his mind. <br /><br />The lion was very angry that no animal had come that day. The hare slowly came towards the lion. The lion roared "Why are you late?" The hare humbly replied, "Oh my way another lion chased me. I got away with much difficulty to give my life to you, Your Majesty". <br /><br />The lion was pleased with the hare. But the thought of another lion in the jungle made him angry. The lion roared "Do you know where he lives?" The hare replied "Yes, Sir. Please come with me". <br /><br />The hare took the lion to the old well. He said "Sir, that lion lives in this well". The lion peeped into the well. He mistook his reflection for another lion. He roared and there was an echo. He thought that the other lion was roaring too and jumped into the well. That was the end of the lion. <br /><br />MORAL : Wisdom can win might.<br />

                        <p>                                                A Mouse and A Lion</p><p>Once, as a lion lay
sleeping in his den, a naughty little mouse ran up his tail, onto his back, up
his mane and danced and jumped on his head, so that the lion woke up.<br /><br />
lion angry grabbed the mouse and, holding him in
his large claws, roared in anger. 'How dare you wake me up! Don't you know that
I am King of the Beasts? Anyone who disturbs my rest deserves to die! I shall
kill you and eat you!'<br /><br />
The terrified mouse, shaking and trembling, begged
the lion to let him go. 'Please don't eat me Your Majesty! I did not mean to
wake you, it was a mistake. I was only playing. Please let me go - and I
promise I will be your friend forever. Who knows but one day I could save your
life?'<br /><br />
The lion looked at the tiny mouse and laughed.
'You save my life? What an absurd idea!' he said scornfully. 'But you have made
me laugh, and put me into a good mood again, so I shall let you go.' And the
lion opened his claws and let the mouse go free.<br /><br />
'Oh thank you, your majesty,' squeaked the mouse,
and scurried away as fast as he could.<br /><br />
A few days later the lion was caught in a hunter's
snare. Struggle as he might, he couldn't break free and became even more
entangled in the net of ropes. He let out a roar of anger that shook the
forest. Every animal heard it, including the tiny mouse.<br /><br />
The mouse was rushing to the source of its roar
and he found the lion was powerless. The mouse then bit the rope that cought
the lion so that the lion can escape from the trap. The lions are very grateful
to the mouse, and they became friends best forever.</p><p>                                 Seekor Tikus dan Seekor Singa<br /></p><p>Suatu ketika ada seekor singa yang sedang berbaring
tidur di sarangnya, tikus kecil nakal berlari ke ekornya, ke punggunya, ke
surainya dan menari serta melompat di kepalanya, sehingga singa itu pun
terbangun.<br /><br />
singa marah menerkam tikus tersebut dan memegangnya dalam
kuku-kukunya yang besar, meraung dalam kemarahan. "Berani-beraninya kau
membangunkan saya! Tidak tahukah kamu bahwa saualah Raja semua binatang?
Siapapun yang mengganggu istirahat saya layak mati! Saya akan membunuhmu dan
makanmu!'<br /><br />
Tikus tersebut ketakutan dan gemetaran, memohon agar sang
singa untuk membiarkannya pergi. 'Tolong jangan makan saya Yang Mulia! Saya
tidak bermaksud untuk membangunkan Anda, itu adalah sebuah kesalahan. Saya
hanya bermain. Tolong biarkan saya pergi - dan saya berjanji akan menjadi teman
Anda selamanya. Siapa tahu suatu hari saya bisa menyelamatkan hidup Anda?'<br /><br />
Singa menatap tikus kecil tersebut dan tertawa. "Kau
menyelamatkan hidup saya? Apa ide tidak masuk akal!" katanya mencemooh.
"Tapi kamu telah membuat saya tertawa, dan menempatkan saya ke dalam
suasana hati yang baik lagi, jadi saya akan membiarkan kamu pergi." Dan
singa membuka cakarnya dan membiarkan tikus itu pergi bebas.<br /><br />
"Oh terima kasih, Yang Mulia, 'decit tikus tersebut, dan
bergegas pergi secepat yang dia bisa.<br /><br />
Beberapa hari kemudian singa itu tertangkap dalam jerat
pemburu. Ia berjuang sebisa mungkin, ia tidak mampu melepaskan diri dan bahkan
menjadi lebih terjerat dalam jaring tali terseubt. Dia mengeluarkan raungan
kemarahan yang mengguncang hutan. Setiap hewan mendengarnya, termasuk tikus
kecil tersebut.<br /><br />Tikus itu pun bergegas menuju ke sumber aungan tersebut dan
ia mendapati sang singa sudah tidak berdaya. Tikus tersebut kemudian menggigit
tali yang menjerat singa sampai putus sehingga sang singa bisa lepas dari jerat
perangkap tersebut. Sang singa sangat berterima kasih pada tikus tersebut, dan
merekapun menjadi teman sejati selamanya.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>smoga membantu..tandai sbg jawaban terbaik ya</p><br />

It was very hard to decide who would be the best of them.<br /><br /><br />One evening, Maura disguised herself and went to the camp of the three sheiks. As they were about to have dinner, Maura asked them for something to eat. The first gave her some left over food. The second Sheik gave her some unappetizing camel’s tail. The third sheik, who was called Hakim, offered her some of the most tender and tasty meat. After dinner, the disguised queen left the sheik’s camp.<br /><br />The following day, the queen invited the three sheiks to dinner at her palace.

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />
