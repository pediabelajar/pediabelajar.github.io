read the and answer the questions.
 why students should stop cheating 
 People say that corruption begins with small practices of dishonesty in daily life. this is very apparent is school. the pressure to pass tests has led many students to cheat during tests. this practice should be discouraged, as cheating has no benefit for students.
 Firs, by cheating, students fail to use their own intelligence. they might underestimate their actual abilities due to anxiety and fear of failure, cheating keeps students from understanding their abilities and potentials. they might actually be able to pass the test if they study hard.
 Second, cheating on other students leads to dependency. students who don't prepare for a test well and cheat other students will get even more anxiox when others can't help them.
 Third, when students cheat, they are actually fooling and lying to themselves. if this continuest, the will be led into the habit of doing anything to get what they want, even if it means doing morally questionable acts. This habit is what starts corrupt practices. cheating during tests is a "small" form of corruption, but as time passes, it can lead to bigger forms.
 Based on those reasons, we can conclude that cheating is a bad habit that should be discourage in students.

                                            Soal Essay HOTS Ujian Sekolah Bahasa Inggris SMA SMK: Versi 1According to the American Psychological Association, chronic stress is linked to the six leading causes of death, i.e. heart disease, cancer, lung ailments, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver and suicide. More than 75 percent of all physician office visits are for stress-related ailments and complaints.What causes stress at the work place? Unreasonable deadlines, a toxic environment or fear of losing one’s job are some of the reasons people experience high stress levels at work.Stress, if channeled properly, can help us focus, speed up our learning and memory as well as accelerate our output, giving us a competitive advantage over our peers. However, if our stress levels are unmanageable and are sustained over a long period of time, it can result in mental, emotional and physical damage.The good news is that in order for us to manage our stress, we don't need to radically overhaul our lives. Small changes that are consistent and applied over a long period of time can make a great impact and reduce our stress levels drastically. Heighten your sense of awareness: Being aware of ourselves and what thoughts we entertain is the first step towards managing stress. We need to "think about what we think."QuestionsWhat does the text talk about?Mention 1 (one) cause of stress among workers as stated in the text.In what way can stress be advantageous? It can ....What kind of damage may stress bring if it is not managed properly? ..., ..., and ....What is one way to reduce stress levels mentioned in the text?​</a>

That meant it was daytime. During these days when the clock seems to control us doesn't that sound kind of nice?Time can mean a lot of different things. That's one way we know how important it is for us. We have so many words about it! The smallest amount of time we can measure is called a *second* . when you put 60 second together, you get one *minute*.if you take 60 minutes, you get one *hour*. The Hands of the clock go all the way around twice in 24 hours, giving us one day .If you want to look at time beyond one day, you leave the clock and look at a calendar instead. There are about 30 day in one month. Some months have an extra day; February has a couple lees. There are 12 months in one *year*. Time never stops.ini soalnya ya :1.

With his kings and queens, his cowboys and Indian, or his spacemen, the child projects himself into a make-believe world. From his imagination-triggered by his own experience, limited though it may be-he provides circumstances of time, place, and relationship between the characters. He then proceeds to behave, that is, to speak and to perform physical actions, in a manner that he believes in appropriate to these circumstances. If the game is to prove interesting, these circumstances must provide a reason for carrying out the actions. He has to rescue the princess from the enchanted castle, or rid the town of dangerous bandits, or get his spaceship into orbit without being detected by the enemy. A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world.
 The paragraph following the above most likely discusses ...  
A.	Children’s vast imagination
B.	The privacy of make-believe world of children
C.	Adult’s resentful reaction toward children’s imagination
D.	Examples of games which may be taken as reality by children
E.	How to restrict children’s imagination</a>

read the and answer the questions.
 why students should stop cheating 
 People say that corruption begins with small practices of dishonesty in daily life. this is very apparent is school. the pressure to pass tests has led many students to cheat during tests. this practice should be discouraged, as cheating has no benefit for students.
 Firs, by cheating, students fail to use their own intelligence. they might underestimate their actual abilities due to anxiety and fear of failure, cheating keeps students from understanding their abilities and potentials. they might actually be able to pass the test if they study hard.
 Second, cheating on other students leads to dependency. students who don't prepare for a test well and cheat other students will get even more anxiox when others can't help them.
 Third, when students cheat, they are actually fooling and lying to themselves. if this continuest, the will be led into the habit of doing anything to get what they want, even if it means doing morally questionable acts. This habit is what starts corrupt practices. cheating during tests is a "small" form of corruption, but as time passes, it can lead to bigger forms.
 Based on those reasons, we can conclude that cheating is a bad habit that should be discourage in students.

Soal Essay HOTS Ujian Sekolah Bahasa Inggris SMA SMK: Versi 1According to the American Psychological Association, chronic stress is linked to the six leading causes of death, i.e. heart disease, cancer, lung ailments, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver and suicide. More than 75 percent of all physician office visits are for stress-related ailments and complaints.What causes stress at the work place? Unreasonable deadlines, a toxic environment or fear of losing one’s job are some of the reasons people experience high stress levels at work.Stress, if channeled properly, can help us focus, speed up our learning and memory as well as accelerate our output, giving us a competitive advantage over our peers. However, if our stress levels are unmanageable and are sustained over a long period of time, it can result in mental, emotional and physical damage.The good news is that in order for us to manage our stress, we don't need to radically overhaul our lives. Small changes that are consistent and applied over a long period of time can make a great impact and reduce our stress levels drastically. Heighten your sense of awareness: Being aware of ourselves and what thoughts we entertain is the first step towards managing stress. We need to "think about what we think."QuestionsWhat does the text talk about?Mention 1 (one) cause of stress among workers as stated in the text.In what way can stress be advantageous? It can ....What kind of damage may stress bring if it is not managed properly? ..., ..., and ....What is one way to reduce stress levels mentioned in the text?​</h2><br />

dari lagu I have a dream:
I have a dream, a song to sing
Aku punya impian, lagu tuk dinyanyikan
To help me cope with anything
Yang menguatkanku tuk hadapi apapun
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
Jika kau lihat keajaiban dalam dongeng
You can take the future even if you fail
Kau bisa gapai masa depan meskipun kau gagal
I believe in angels
Aku percaya adanya malaikat
Something good in everything I see

I have a dream, a fantasy
Aku punya impian, fantasi
To help me through reality
Yang menguatkanku hadapi kenyataan
And my destination makes it worth the while
Dan tujuanku membuatnya jadi layak
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
Hadapi kegelapan, meski masih jauh
I believe in angels
Aku percaya adanya malaikat
Something good in everything I see
Ada kebaikan dalam segala yang kulihat
I believe in angels
Aku percaya adanya malaikat
When I know the time is right for me
Saat kutahu waktunya tepat untukku

                            32. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris ____ To some extent the comparison is apt, and to a degree it is helpful in understanding what an actor does when he is creating and performing a role. With his kings and queens, his cowboys and Indian, or his spacemen, the child projects himself into a make-believe world. From his imagination-triggered by his own experience, limited though it may be-he provides circumstances of time, place, and relationship between the characters. He then proceeds to behave, that is, to speak and to perform physical actions, in a manner that he believes in appropriate to these circumstances. If the game is to prove interesting, these circumstances must provide a reason for carrying out the actions. He has to rescue the princess from the enchanted castle, or rid the town of dangerous bandits, or get his spaceship into orbit without being detected by the enemy. A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world.
 The paragraph following the above most likely discusses ...  
A.	Children’s vast imagination
B.	The privacy of make-believe world of children
C.	Adult’s resentful reaction toward children’s imagination
D.	Examples of games which may be taken as reality by children
E.	How to restrict children’s imagination</h2><br />
                        Jenis pertanyaannya adalah Transition Question, pertanyaan tentang topik paragraf sebelum bacaan atau topik paragraf sesudah bacaan.<br /><br /><strong>Trik: Baca kalimat terakhir bacaan tersebut.</strong><br /><br />Sehingga untuk menjawab pertanyaan ini, maka baca kalimat terakhir yaitu "A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world".<br />kalimat ini berkisar tentang imajinasi anak kecil. Oleh karena itu, paragraf selanjutnya akan berkisar dengan hal yang sama (children vast imagination)<br /><br /><strong>Jawaban: A</strong><br />

                            37. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris ____ To some extent the comparison is apt, and to a degree it is helpful in understanding what an actor does when he is creating and performing a role. With his kings and queens, his cowboys and Indian, or his spacemen, the child projects himself into a make-believe world. From his imagination-triggered by his own experience, limited though it may be-he provides circumstances of time, place, and relationship between the characters. He then proceeds to behave, that is, to speak and to perform physical actions, in a manner that he believes in appropriate to these circumstances. If the game is to prove interesting, these circumstances must provide a reason for carrying out the actions. He has to rescue the princess from the enchanted castle, or rid the town of dangerous bandits, or get his spaceship into orbit without being detected by the enemy. A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world.
