                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

Because of her love to Tumang, Dayang Sumbi knew, it was his heart not a deer's heart. She got very angry at Sangkuriang. She hit him with a piece of wood on his forehead and told him to go away. Badly wounded, Sangkuriang left her and the village
</p><p>One day Sangkuriang went back to his village. He was big and strong. There he met a beautiful young woman. He fell in love with her at first sight. He did not know that she was Dayang Sumbi. She could never get older because she was granted eternal youth by the gods
</p><p>One day he approached Dayang Sumbi to propose her. Dayang Sumbi saw the bad scar on his forehead. She soon realized that he was her own son, Sangkuriang. She told him the truth again and again but he would not believe her. She was thinking hard to find a way not to marry him. Then she got an idea. She gave him a task which she thought was impossible for him to do. She asked him to make her a lake and a boat in one night. She did not know Sangkuriang had genies to help him to do the task.
</p><p>By dawn both the lake and the boat were almost done. Dayang Sumbi got very worried. She was thinking hard again to find a way to fail him. Then she had an idea. She asked the people in the village to burn the woods in the east, so that the light made all the cocks in the village crow. The genies thought that the morning was almost broken. They ran away as fast they could, leaving the boat unfinished. Knowing Dayang Sumbi cheated him, Sangkuriang got very angry. He kicked the boat so hard that it went upside down.

If you are male, I will marry you</p><p>Suddenly a male dog, its name was Tumang, came.  He brought her the falling tool.  Dayang Sumbi was very surprised.  She regretted her words but she could not deny it.  So she had to marry Tumang and leave her father.  Then they lived in a small village.  Several months later they had a son.  His name was Sangkuriang.  He was a handsome and healthy boy.</p><p>Sangkuriang liked hunting very much.  He often went hunting to the wood using his arrow.  When he went hunting Tumang always with him.  In the past there were many deer in Java so Sangkuriang often hunted for deer.</p><p></p><p>One day  Dayang Sumbi wanted to have deer’s heart so she asked Sangkuriang to hunt for a deer.   Then Sangkuriang went to the wood with his arrow and his faithful dog Tumang.  But after several days in the wood Sangkuriang could not find any deer.  They were all disappeared.  Sangkuriang was exhausted and desperate.  He did not want to disappoint her mother so he killed Tumang.  He did not know that Tumang was his father.  At home he gave Tumang’s heart to her mother.</p><p>But Dayang Sumbi knew that it was Tumang’s heart.  She was so angry that she could not control her emotion.  She hit Sangkuriang at his head.  Sangkuriang was wounded.  There was  a scar in his head.    She also repelled her son.   Sangkuriang left her mother in sadness.</p><p>Many years passed and Sangkuriang became a strong young man.  He wandered  everywhere.     One day he arrived at his own village but he did not realized it.  There he met Dayang Sumbi.  At the time Dayang Sumbi was given an eternal beauty by God so she stayed young forever.  Both of them did not know each other.  So they fell in love and then they decided to marry.</p><p></p><p>But then Dayang Sumbi recognized a scar on his Sangkuriang’s head.  She knew that Sangkuriang was his son.  It was impossible for them to marry.  She told him but he did not believe her.  He wished that they marry soon.  So Dayang Sumbi gave a very difficult condition.  She wanted Sangkuriang to build a lake and a boat in one night!  She said she needed that for honeymoon.</p><p>Sangkuriang agreed.  With the help of genie and spirits Sangkuriang tried to build them.  By midnight he had finished  the lake by building a dam in Citarum river.  Then he started building the boat.  It was almost dawn when he nearly finished it.  Meanwhile Dayang Sumbi kept watching on them.  She was very worried when she knew this.  So she made lights in the east.  Then the spirits thought that it was already dawn.  It was time for them to leave.  They left Sangkuriang alone.  Without their help he could not finish the boat.</p><p>Sangkuriang was very angry.  He kicked the boat.  Then the boat turned out to be Mount Tangkuban Perahu.  It means boat upside down.  From a distant it looks like a boat upside down.</p><br />

He was almost going to throw it away because he thought that someone was mengerjainya. But once you think about it, he took it home and realized that it was an egg of pure gold!<br />She sells the eggs for money very much. Every morning the goose laying the golden eggs to another, and the farmers became rich by selling eggs.<br />When he became rich, he also grew greedy. "Why do I have to wait to get only one egg a day?" He thought. "I will cut the goose and take all the eggs out of the body at once."<br />When the goose heard the farmer's plan, he immediately flew away to another farm nearby. So, when the farmer came out the next day, you know what he found in the swan's nest? Nothing.<br />Moral: People who always want more frequent sometimes lose everything. If you want something, be patient. If you are greedy, you may lose what you already have.<br /><br />atau<br /><br />A Wolf and Dog<br />Once upon a time there was a wolf who nearly died of starvation. He is very thin, so that the line can be seen clearly bones under his thinning hair. With barely enough energy to run, wolves have little hope of finding food. As he lay down under a large tree, a dog was out for a walk to see him. Look how skinny and hungry wolves, the dog felt sorry for him and said, "You are very terrible condition! You looked as if had not eaten for days."<br />"You're right," said the wolf. "I do not eat because you and your friends do a good job of keeping the sheep. Now I'm so weak that I had little hope of finding food. I thought I would die."<br />Then why not join us? asked the dog. "I work out regularly and I eat regularly. You can also do the same. I will set it up. You can help me and other dogs guard the sheep. In that way, we will not have to worry about theft of sheep again and you do not have to worry about going hungry again. It's a good deal for both of us. "<br />The wolf thought about it for a few minutes and then decided that the dog was right. So they went together to the farm house where the dog lived. But, while on the journey, the wolf saw that the hair in a certain part of the dog's neck is very thin. He was curious about it, for dogs that have such a beautiful coat every body. Finally, he asked the dog about it.<br />"Oh, do not worry about it," said the dog. "This is the place where former rope on my neck when I bind my lord at night."<br />"Diikiat!" cried wolf, "you mean that you are chained at night? If I come to stay with you, I will also be chained at night?"<br />That's right, "said the dog." But, you'll get used to it pretty quickly. I do not think about it anymore. "<br />"But, if I was chained, then I will not be able to walk when I want to go for a walk or to run where I want to run," said the wolf. "If I come to stay with you, I will not be free again." Having said that, the wolf turned around and ran.<br />

                        <p> </p><p></p> the legend of Tangkuban boat<p></p><p>  Once upon a time in the land of Pasundan, West Java, there was a beautiful heavenly goddess.  Her name is Dayang Sumbi.  He lives in a hut in the forest with his loyal dog, Tumang.</p><p></p><p>  One day, while weaving cloth, he lost one of his tools.  Tired of looking everywhere, Dayang Sumbi said to herself, “Whoever can find a lost tool and return it to me, if he is a man, I will make him a husband and if he is a woman, I will make him big.  sibling "</p><p></p><p>  To his surprise, Tumang found the tool and returned it to him.

Sangkuriang grew into a healthy teenager who likes to hunt animals in the forest.  Dayang Sumbi never told Sangkuriang that Tumang was his father.</p><p></p><p>  One day, Sangkuriang and Tumang were hunting deer in the forest.  Soon they met a wild boar.  Sangkuriang wondered, "Why are there no deer today? But, I don't think wild boars will make any difference."  Sangkuriang shouted Tumang, "Go and fight the wild boar. Just kill it for me!"</p><p></p><p>  Surprisingly, Tumang did not kill the wild boar because the boar was Dayang Sumbi's mother.  The pig left safely.

The liver you ate was Tumang's liver."</p><p></p><p>  "You! You are a stupid child!"  Dayang Sumbi shouted while hitting the soup spoon on Sangkuriang's head so hard that his head bled.  "Get out of my face, you murderous bastard. How dare you kill your own father? You are a useless son!"</p><p></p><p>  With a bloody head, Sangkuriang ran into the forest and up the hill.  Years passed, Sangkuriang turned into a handsome and skilled hunter.  He had forgotten all the bitter past because he had lost his memory.  He even forgot his name.</p><p></p><p>  One day, Sangkuriang met a beautiful woman in the forest whom he loved.  That woman is Dayang Sumbi, who cannot grow old because she is a goddess.  Sangkuriang did not recognize his own mother, but Dayang Sumbi recognized Sangkuriang from the old scar on his head.</p><p></p><p>  Drunk in love, Sangkuriang proposed to her.  To avoid a forbidden marriage between mother and daughter, Dayang Sumbi asked him to make a lake and a boat in one night as a wedding gift for him.  With the help of supernatural beings from the forest, Sangkuriang built a lake and a boat.  Dayang Sumbi knew it and she tricked the jinn by lighting a fire so that it seemed as if the sun had risen.  Knowing this, Sangkuriang was so angry that he kicked the boat and the boat overturned.

                        “story of romance” is the guiding text offered by contemporary American culture, and more generally the culture of the modern West, on the subject of how women and men (should) relate: find your One True Love—your one-and-only—and live happily ever after.[1] To the ancient and perennial question of how to define and live the good life, how to achieve happiness and fulfillment, American pop culture’s resounding answer is through the narrative of romance, sex, and love. The happily-in-love, pair-bonded (generally, although increasingly not exclusively, heterosexual) couple is made into a near-mandatory norm by the media and popular culture, as this romance story is endlessly taught and replayed in a multiplicity of cultural sites: Disney princess movies consumed by three-year-olds, the wedding industry, Hollywood, pop music lyrics, advertising, popular magazines, the diamond jewelry industry, and more. One of the most important of these sites, where romance is taught, re-told, and—a crucial point—experimented with in new forms, is in the literal “romance story” of mass market genre fiction.While there are clearly significant differences—among these media forms and certainly among the diversity of the immense romance readership, as well as in the variety of subgenres and plots within the romance publishing field—nonetheless there are significant similarities across these categories as well. The basic plotline of the romance narrative holds true despite subgenre variation, which, as we’ll see in the case of erotica and paranormal, can serve simply to highlight the core genre message. As such, likening readers and novels and considering the phenomenon of romance narrative as a whole allows important insights to emerge. More specifically, in this article, I argue romance novels are so popular partly because they do deep and complicated work for the (mostly) women who read them—work that derives from the mythic or religious nature of the romance narrative that serves to engage readers in a “reparation fantasy” of healing in regards to male-female relations. Romance novels help women readers, especially heterosexual women, deal with their essentially paradoxical relationship toward men within a culture still marked by patriarchy and its component threat of violence toward women.[2]Most baldly put, this paradox has women in a position of simultaneously desiring and fearing men. Romance novels function as an antidote, as a way of pleasurably working through—in fantasy, in the safe and imaginative play world of fiction—the contradictory position of the heterosexual woman within patriarchal rape culture. This complex work, we will see, involves reconciling women to the limits and threats specifically posed to them as women by the culture, yet also teaching women to refuse to accept such limits and threats as normative and empowering them to expect or demand better for themselves. Furthermore, I argue that the industry subcategories of erotica (including gay/lesbian and “slash” romance) and paranormal—both areas of strong recent growth within the overall genre—offer new and highly effective literary means for women to use romance fiction as a way of working out their position within the culture. Indeed, the mainstream growth of erotica in particular signals important changes in American cultural attitudes towards women’s sexuality and perhaps, finally, a loosening of the patriarchal knot of allowable sexual expression.This article forms the initial part of an ongoing monograph project on the romance narrative in popular culture, focusing especially on popular romance fiction. I seek to understand how this romance narrative functions and how it is currently changing, both as a genre of popular literature and as a form of human relationship. Unlike some lines of previous academic inquiry into romance fiction, my goal has little to do with either critique or defense of the genre, nor do I aim for close literary reading of individual authors (e.g., Radway 1991, Coddington 1997, Regis 2003, Goade 2007). Like Tania Modleski, I seek to read “symptomatically” (2008, xix), not intending by this metaphor for romance fiction to be taken as illness or pathology, but simply as a rich cultural site that yields much insight into critical issues of gender and sexuality in America today. I seek to place romance fiction in the broader context of the romance narrative in popular culture; and to adopt a framework of cultural studies, religious studies, gender studies, and sex-positive feminist theory to ask questions about meaning, fantasy, fear, and desire in how the romance narrative plays out in the realms of both popular and high culture in which this story holds such vast sway.<br /><br />
