<p> </p>

<p>Long
ago, people lived happily under the rule of a king. The people of the kingdom
were very happy as they led a very prosperous life with an abundance of wealth
and no misfortunes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once,
the king decided to go visiting places of historical importance and pilgrim
centres at distant places. He decided to travel by foot to interact with his
people. People of distant places were very happy to have a conversation with
their king. They were proud that their king had a kind heart.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>After
several weeks of travel, the king returned to the palace. He was quite happy
that he had visited many pilgrim centres and witnessed his people leading a
prosperous life. However, he had one regret.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He
had intolerable pain in his feet as it was his first trip by foot covering a
long distance. He complained to his ministers that the roads weren't
comfortable and that they were very stony. He could not tolerate the pain. He
said that he was very much worried about the people who had to walk along those
roads as it would be painful for them too!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Considering
all this, he ordered his servants to cover the roads in the whole country with
leather so that the people of his kingdom can walk comfortably.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The
king's ministers were stunned to hear his order as it would mean that thousands
of cows would have to be slaughtered in order to get sufficient quantity of
leather. And it would cost a huge amount of money also.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Finally,
a wise man from the ministry came to the king and said that he had another
idea. The king asked what the alternative was. The minister said, "Instead
of covering the roads with leather, why don't you just have a piece of leather
cut in appropriate shape to cover your feet?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The
king was very much surprised by his suggestion and applauded the wisdom of the
minister. He ordered a pair of leather shoes for himself and requested all his
countrymen also to wear shoes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Moral:
Instead of trying to change the world, we should try to change ourselves.</p><br />

                        “The Smartest Parrot“<br /><br /><br /><br />Once upon time, a man had a wonderful parrot. There was no other parrot like it. The parrot could say every word, except the name of the place where it was born, “Catano”.<br /><br />The man felt excited having the smartest parrot but he could not understand why the parrot would not say “Catano”. The man tried to teach the bird to say “Catano” however the parrot kept not saying the word.<br /><br />At the first, the man was very nice to the bird but then he got very angry. “You stupid bird!” pointed the man to the parrot. “Why can’t you say the word? Say Catano! Or I will kill you” the man said angrily. Although he tried hard to teach, the parrot would not say it. Then the man got so angry and shouted to the bird over and over; “Say Catano or I’ll kill you”. The bird kept not to say the word of Catano.<br /><br />One day, after he had been trying so many times to make the bird say “Catano”, the man really got very angry. He could not bear it. He picked the parrot and threw it into the chicken house. There were four old chickens for next dinner “You are as stupid as the chickens. Just stay with them” Said the man angrily. Then he continued to humble; “You know, I will cut the chicken for my meal. Next it will be your turn, I will eat you too, stupid parrot”. After that he left the chicken house.<br /><br />The next day, the man came back to the chicken house. He opened the door and was very surprised. He could not believe what he saw at the chicken house. There were three death chickens on the floor. At the moment, the parrot was standing proudly and screaming at the last old chicken; “Say Catano or I’ll kill you”.<br />

The lesung; was happy and thanked the old woman.The little boy continued his journey. While he was passing through the village, he saw many people gathering on the field. The boy came closer and saw a stick stuck in the ground. People challenged each other to pull out that stick. Everybody tried, but nobody succeeded. Can I try?; asked the little boy. The crowd laughed mockingly. The boy wanted to try his luck so he stepped forward and pulled out the stick. He could do it very easily. Everybody was dumbfounded.<br /><br />Suddenly, from the hole left by stick, water spouted out. It did not stop until it flooded the village. And no one was saved from the water except the little boy and the generous old woman who gave him shelter and meal. As she told him, he used the lesung; as a boat and picked up the old woman. The whole village became a huge lake. It is now known as Rawa Pening Lake in Salatiga, Central Java, Indonesia.<br /><br />

She was known for her curiosity and love for adventure. One day, as she explored an old abandoned house on the outskirts of the village, she stumbled upon a hidden door in the attic.</p><p></p><p>Intrigued by the mysterious door, Lily decided to investigate further. She searched the entire house for a key that could unlock it, but to no avail. Determined not to give up, she sought the help of the elderly villagers who had lived in the area for many years. However, none of them had ever seen or heard of the key.</p><p></p><p>Undeterred, Lily scoured the library in search of any books or ancient texts that could provide her with clues about the hidden door. After days of tireless research, she stumbled upon an old folktale that spoke of a magical key hidden deep within the heart of the forest.</p><p></p><p>Armed with this newfound knowledge, Lily embarked on a perilous journey into the depths of the forest. The dense foliage and eerie silence added to the sense of mystery and excitement. She ventured through tangled vines and treacherous terrain, never losing sight of her goal.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Lily discovered a hidden clearing adorned with vibrant flowers and shimmering sunlight. In the center of the clearing stood a majestic oak tree, its branches swaying gently in the breeze. Lily felt a sense of wonder and awe, as if she had stumbled upon something truly magical.</p><p></p><p>Approaching the ancient oak, Lily noticed a small hollow at its base. With a surge of anticipation, she reached inside and pulled out a rusted key, covered in moss and forgotten by time. It was the key she had been searching for all along.</p><p></p><p>Filled with excitement, Lily rushed back to the abandoned house. As she inserted the key into the hidden door, a soft click echoed through the attic. The door creaked open, revealing a hidden room filled with old treasures and artifacts. It was as if time had stood still within those walls.</p><p></p><p>Word of Lily's discovery quickly spread throughout the village, and people came from far and wide to witness the forgotten room's wonders. The once-desolate house became a symbol of adventure and mystery, attracting tourists and historians alike.</p><p></p><p>Lily's determination and curiosity had not only unlocked the hidden door but also revived a forgotten piece of history. Her story served as a reminder to everyone that sometimes, the most extraordinary things can be found in the most unexpected places.</p><p></p><p>From that day forward, Lily became known as the girl who found "The Forgotten Key," and her tale continued to inspire generations to embrace curiosity, seek adventure, and never underestimate the power of the unknown.</p><br />

                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

                        Beauty and the beast<br /><br />
Once
 upon a time as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of his 
three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The 
first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but 
the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest 
of them all, said to her father:  



 "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"   

<br /> When
 the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a
 sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the 
howling gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching
 an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of
 a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.   

"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. 

<br /> When
 he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody 
came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling 
out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner
 lay already served. The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner
 of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.  <br />
Overcome
 by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into 
magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a 
soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could 
not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. 

<br /> When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.  The
 merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to
 thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was 
nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it 
all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to
 a tree.<br />soal:1. who is the antagonist act on the story?2. how can the beast return to a handsome person?<br /><br /><br />

So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.</p><p>Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.</p><p>Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.</p><p>Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam).</p><br />

                                                 Jaka Tarub <br /> Once upon a time there was a widow who lived in the village of Dadapan.  She had a son whose name was Jaka Tarub.  Dadapan village was close to a wood so Jaka Tarub liked to go to the wood.  He liked hunting for animals with his blowpipe.<br />One day when he was in the wood he saw a beautiful rainbow and he saw seven angels went down through it.  He came closer and searched for them.  The seven angels were swimming and taking a bath in a lake.  Jaka Tarub looked at them while hiding behind trees.  When they had finished taking a bath, they flew through the rainbow to heaven.<br />The next day he saw the same thing again.  This time Jaka Tarub had an idea.  He searched for their dress and when he found them he took one of them.  As they had finished swimming and taking a bath, they looked for their dress.  One of them could not find her dress.  Her friends had to come back to heaven so they left her.  She was crying while staying in the water.  Jaka Tarub approached her.<br />‘Why are you crying lady?’<br />‘I lose my dress so I cannot go home’<br />‘Where is your home?’<br />‘I live in heaven.  I’m an angel.  My name is Nawang Wulan.  But I lose my dress so I cannot fly anymore’<br />‘I you don’t mind I will take my mother’s dress for you’<br />‘OK, please do’<br />‘Wait for me here, I’ll be back’<br />Then Jaka Tarub went home to take her mother’s dress and gave it to Nawang Wulan.  He asked her to stay at her house with his mother.  Not long after that Jaka Tarub married Nawang Wulan.<br />As an angel Nawang Wulan had spiritual power.  She had ability which far above human being.  She could cook rice with just a bar of rice and when it had done the bowl will be full of rice.  But there was one condition.  The bowl must not be opened before it has done.  Jaka Tarub was very surprised with her wife’s ability. He was very curious about it.  So when Nawang Wulan was away he opened the bowl.  Consequently Nawang’s spiritual power disappeared.  She had to cook as ordinary human being.<br />Several months later Nawang Wulan gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.  Her name was Nawang Sih.  The birth of Nawang Sih added happiness to Jaka Tarub and Nawang Wulan.<br />Since Nawang Wulan could not cook efficiently anymore, she needed more rice than usual.  The stock of rice in their store room diminished rapidly.  Then one day when she took rice there she was very surprised.  Nawang Wulan found her angel dress.  It was hidden there under piles of rice.  She immediately wore it and talked to Jaka Tarub.<br />‘My dear husband, now I know what you did to me’<br />‘Forgive me, my dear.  I admit that I did this because I love you’<br />‘I love you too.  But now I find my dress.  I must come back to heaven.  I am an angel.  My place is not here.  I have to go now’.<br />‘How about Nawang Sih?  She needs you’‘I will leave her but don’t worry.  I will take care of her.  Anytime she needs me I will be here.  For that purpose please build a tower. When Nawang Sih cries put her there then call my name. I will come immediately.  But I will be invisible to you.  Good bye dear’<br />Then Jaka Tarub built a tower behind his house.  Every time Nawang Sih cried he would put her there.  Nawang Wulan would come and take care of Nawang Sih.      ...... SEMOGA MEMBANTU........<br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Title: The Enchanted Quill: A Tale of Endless Imagination</p><p></p><p>Once in a quaint village, there lived a young girl named Amara. Amara had always possessed a vivid imagination that set her apart from her peers. She loved to spend her days exploring the lush meadows and ancient forests that surrounded her village, allowing her imagination to run wild.</p><p></p><p>One fateful day, while wandering deep into the heart of the forest, Amara stumbled upon a hidden glade. In the center of the glade, she discovered a shimmering quill resting atop a moss-covered stone. It was unlike any quill she had ever seen before, with intricate carvings and a brilliant golden hue. Curiosity overwhelmed her, and she couldn't resist picking it up.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Amara touched the quill, a surge of magical energy coursed through her body. Suddenly, the quill came to life, glowing brightly and emitting a soft hum. Amara's eyes widened with wonder as she realized that this was no ordinary quill—it possessed the power to bring her imagination to life.</p><p></p><p>With the enchanted quill in her hand, Amara's creative ideas took on a life of their own. She began to draw magnificent creatures and fantastical landscapes, and to her amazement, they materialized before her eyes. Majestic dragons soared through the sky, mythical creatures roamed the forests, and castles appeared in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Amara's village soon became a place of enchantment and wonder, as word of her extraordinary gift spread. People from far and wide flocked to witness her creations, eager to experience the magic that her drawings brought to life. Amara shared her gift with others, encouraging them to embrace their own imagination and unlock the endless possibilities within.</p><p></p><p>However, as Amara continued to explore her newfound powers, she realized that the quill was beginning to lose its brilliance. The drawings she brought to life became fainter and less vibrant with each passing day. Worried that she would lose the quill's magic entirely, Amara embarked on a quest to discover the secret behind its fading power.</p><p></p><p>Through her journey, Amara encountered wise sages, mythical beings, and faced various challenges that tested her determination. Finally, after much perseverance, she reached the fabled Fountain of Imagination. Legend had it that drinking from this magical fountain would restore the quill's power.</p><p></p><p>With hope in her heart, Amara took a sip from the fountain, feeling a surge of renewed energy flow through her. She returned to her village, the quill now shining brighter than ever. Amara continued to use her gift, filling her village and the world with awe-inspiring wonders and spreading the joy of imagination.</p><p></p><p>From that day forward, the village became known as "Imaginaria," a place where dreams and imagination knew no bounds. Amara's enchanted quill became a symbol of the limitless power of creativity and the importance of nurturing one's imagination.</p><p></p><p>And so, the tale of "The Enchanted Quill" reminds us that within our minds lies the power to create extraordinary worlds and bring our wildest dreams to life. Embrace your imagination, for it is a gift that holds the key to endless possibilities.</p><p></p><br />

                        The Origin of The Name “Singapore”<br /><br />A hundred years ago there lived a king named Nila Utama, King of Srivijaya. One day, the king went sailing accompanied by his loyal bodyguards. Along the way, the hurricane came. The guards begged the king to cancel his plan. “Sir, it is dangerous if we continue the journey with this condition. It’s better if we stop first to a safer place. If I am not mistaken, there is a place nearby here named Tumasik Island. “What if we stay there while waiting for a safer condition?” Said the captain of the ship. The king approved this opinion. Their boat was docked to Tumasik Island shortly afterwards.<br /><br />Arriving on the island, King and several bodyguards left the ship and looked around the island. When they’re looking around, suddenly an animal which was not far from them flashed. The king was surprised and fascinated. The beast was so huge, looked dashing, and was golden in color.” What creature was that?” Asked the King to his guards. “If i am not mistaken, people call it “Singa”, your majesty,” one of his bodyguards replied. “What?” Asked the King to clarify. “Singa” replied the guard.<br /><br />The king then asked more explanation about the animal. Attentively, The King listened to all explanations from his bodyguard about the animal. “Then, we give the name of this place “Singapore”.”Meaning: The City of Lion which is derived from malay “Singa” (lion) and “Pura / Pore” (City)”. Since that time the town was named Singapore.<br /><br /><br />
