                                            Tolong carikan general classificationEarthquakes are the rumblings, shaking or rolling of the earth’s surface. It is usually what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another, or break apart from each other as a result of tension caused by prolonged energy build up. It brings great damages and it is hard to be predicted.    There are three kinds of earthquakes. This kinds of earthquakes are commonly based on the factor and geological are where the earthquakes happen. This three kinds of earthquakes are tectonic, volcanic, and explosion.    Tectonic earthquakes is most common one. This kind of earthquakes happens while's crust rocks break because of the geological strength created by moving of the earth's plates. Volcanic earthquakes happen exactly with volcanic activity. Volcanic earthquakes are when the volcano produced acidic lava which dry quickly, when it drys quickly blocks. The top of the volcano. This make no more magma can escape. Pressure starts to build up and eventualy the addic lava can no longger stand the pressure. So the volcano is free to explode, the plessure is released so fast that an earthquakes is caused.    Explosion earthquakes are the result of the collapse earthquakes that are small earthquakes occuring in underground mines and caverns</a>

                                            A. Read the following text, and then answer the question below! 
 Earthquakes
Earthquakes - being among the most deadly natural hazards - strike without any prior warning, leaving catastrophe in their wake with terrible loss of human lives as well as economic loss.
Technically, an earthquake (also known as tremor, quake or temblor) is a kind of vibration through the earth’s crust. This vibration occurs as a result of powerful movement of rocks in the earth’s crust. These powerful movements trigger a rapid release of energy that creates seismic waves that travel through the earth. Earthquakes are usually brief, but may repeat over a long period of time. (Earth Science. 2001)
Earthquakes are classified as large and small. Large earthquakes usually begin with slight tremors but rapidly take form of violent shocks. The vibration from a large earthquake last for a few days known as aftershocks. Small earthquake are usually slight tremors and do not cause much damage. Large earthquakes are known to take down building and cause death and injury (Richter, 1935). According to some statistics, there may be an average of 500,000 earthquakes every year but only about 100,000 can be felt and about 100 or so can cause damage each year.
Earthquakes are dreaded by everyone.

Kinds of Earthquake 
Earthquake often happens around us. It brings great damages. Earthquake is hard to be predicted and that makes lot victims. 
Actually there are three kinds of earthquake. These kinds of earthquake are commonly base on the factor and geological area where the earthquakes happen. These three kinds of earthquake are tectonic, volcanic and explosion.
Tectonic earthquakes is most common one. This kind of earthquake happens while earth’s crust rocks break because of the geological strength created by moving of the earth’s plates.
Volcanic earthquakes happen exactly with volcanic activity. Volcanic earthquakes are when the volcano produces acidic lava, which dries quickly; when it dries quickly it blocks the top of the volcano. This make no more magma can escape. Pressure starts to build up and eventually the acidic lava can no longer stand the pressure. So the volcano is free to explode, the pressure is released so fast that an earthquake is caused. A volcanic earthquake is usually kept within 10-20 miles of the volcano.
Explosion earthquakes are the result of the collapse earthquakes that are small earthquakes occurring in underground mines and caverns.

Seismology studies the frequency, type and size of earthquakes. Earthquakes are measured using observation by seismometers. The magnitude of an earthquakes and its intensity is recorded on a numerical scale known as Richter scale. On this scale, 3 or less is hardly noticeable. Earthquakes with magnitude of more than 6.5 can cause heavy damage.The effects of an earthquake are strongest in the area which near its epicenter. The extent of the earthquakes vibration and further damage to the region is partly dependent on the features of the ground. The worst possible damage occurs in the densely populated areas where structures are not built to withstand intense shaking. Damage and loss of life incurred during earthquake is due to falling buildings and flying glass and objects. In certain areas, an earthquake can cause mudslides that can bury areas under it.

Earthquake is hard to be predicted and that makes lot victims. Actually there are three kinds of earthquake. This kinds of earthquake are commonly base on the factor and geological area where the eartquakes happen. These three kinds of earthquake are tectonic, volcanic, and explosion. Tectonic eartquakes are most common one. This kind of earthquake happens while earth's crust rocks break because of the geological strength created by moving of the earth's plates. Volcanic earthquakes happen exactly with volcanic activity. Volcanic earthquakes are when the volcano produces acidic lava, which dries quickly ;when it dries quickly it blocks the top of the volcano. This make no more magma can escape. Pressure starts to build up and eventually the acidic lava can no longer stand the pressure. So the volcano is free to explode, the pressure is released so fast that an earthquake is caused. A volcanic earthquake is usually kept within 10-20 miles of the volcano. Explosion earthquakes are the result of the collapse earthquakes that are small earthquakes occuring in underground mines and caverns.

This vibration occurs as result of powerful movement of rocks in the earth’s crust. These powerful movements trigger a rapid release of energy that creates seismic waves that travel through the earth. Earthquakes are usually brief, but may repeat over along period of time.(Earth Sience.2001)Earthquakes are classified as large and small. Large earthquakes usually begin with slight tremors but rapidly take form of violent shocks. The vibrations from a large earthquake last for few days known as aftershocks. Small earthquakes are usually slight tremors and do not cause much damage. Large earthquakes are known to take down building and cause death and injury (Richter, 1935)According to some statistics, there may be an average of 500,000 earthquakes every year but only about 100,000 can be felt and about 100 or so can cause damage each year.The study of earthquakes is called seismology. Seismology studies the frequency, type and size of earthquakes. Earthquakes are measured using observation by seismometers. The magnitude of an earthquakes and its intensity is recorded on a numerical scale known as Richter scale. On this scale, 3 or less is hardly noticeable. Earthquakes with magnitude of more than 6.5 can cause heavy damage.The effects of an earthquake are strongest in the area which near its epicenter. The extent of the earthquakes vibration and further damage to the region is partly dependent on the features of the ground. The worst possible damage occurs in the densely populated areas where structures are not built to withstand intense shaking. Damage and loss of life incurred during earthquake is due to falling buildings and flying glass and objects. In certain areas, an earthquake can cause mudslides that can bury areas under it.

                                            EARTHQUAKES
 Earthquake is the shaking of the Earths surface caused by rapid movement of the earth's rocky outer layer. Earthquakes occur when energy stored within the Earth,  usually in the form of strain in rocks, suddenly releases. This enegy tansmitted to the surface of the earth by earthquake waves . 
 The destruction an earthquake causes depends on its magnitude and duration, or the amount of shaking that occurs. A structure's design and the materials used in its also affect the amount of damage the structure incurs.  Earthquakes vary from small,  unnoticeable shaking to large shocks felt over thousands of kilometers. Earthauakes can deform the ground, make buildings and other structures collapse and create tsunamis lange sea waves).  Lives may be lost in the resulting destruction.
 Earthquakes occur at a rate of several hundred per day around the world. A worldwide network of seismographs (machines that record movements of the Earty) detect about 1 million small earthquakes per year. very large earthquakes, such as the 1964 Alaskan earthquake and the 2004  in Aceh Indonesia,  which caused malions of dollars in damage and thousands victims, occur worldwide once every few years .Moderate earthquakes such an the 1989 tremor in California ,USA the 1995 tremor in Kobe Japan, occur about 20 times year. Moderate earthquakes also cause millions of dollars in damage and can harm many people.
In the last 500 years,  several million people have been killed by earthquakes around the world. Worldwide,  earthquakes have also caused severe poperty and structural damage.  Adequate precautions, such as education ,emergency planning, and constructing stronger, more flexible, safely designed structures can limit the loss of life and decrease the damage caused by earthquakes.
seismologists have been monitoring me frequency and locations of earthquakes for most of the 20th century. They generally classify naturally occuring earthquakes into one of two categories: interplate and intraplate. Intraplate earthquakes are the most common ; they occur primarily along plate bounderies. intraplate earthquakes occur where the crust is factuaring whitin a plate. Both interplate and intraplate earthquakes may be caused by tectonic or volcanic forces.
Tectonic earthquakes are caused by the suddeb release of energy stored within the rocks along a fault. The released energy is produced by the strain on the rocks due to movement within the earth, called tectonic deformation. The effect is like the sudden breaking and snapping back of a stretched elastic band
Volcanic earthquakes occur near active volcanoes but have the same fauot slip mechanism as tectonic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes are caused by the upwad movement of magma under the volcano, which strains the rock locally and leads to an earthquake. As the fluid magma rises to the surface of the volcano, it moves and fractures rock masses and causes contious fremors that can past up to several hours of days.

Earthquake
Earthquake is a natural process that often occurs around us. It can produce a big shock of waves that can destroy anything. The earthquake is also very difficult to be predicted. However, earthquake’s power can be measured using a tool called seismograph. There are two types of earthquakes that categorized by geological factors and the area where the earthquake occurred. Both of types are tectonic and volcanic.
Tectonic earthquakes are one of the most common earthquakes. This occurred when the earth’s crust rocks broken because geological force created by the movement of tectonic plates. This type of earthquakes can cause any damage or natural disaster. Its strong vibrations are capable to spread into other parts of the earth quickly.
The second is volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes occur due to magma activity inside the volcano. If the magma activity is getting higher, it will cause an explosion and earthquake vibrations. Volcanic earthquakes can be felt just around the volcano.
Earthquakes can cause the damage, if the power produced is quite large. The damages include: the buildings, the ground, and even can cause a tsunami.</a>

It'snot just one piece of land, but also about 20 piecesthat are always moving. We don't feel thismovement because the pieces move quite slowly.Each of these pieces is called a tectonic plate. Whenone tectonic plate slips under or against anothertectonic plate, an earthquake occurs.​</a>

                                            EARTHQUAKES
 Earthquake is the shaking of the Earths surface caused by rapid movement of the earth's rocky outer layer. Earthquakes occur when energy stored within the Earth,  usually in the form of strain in rocks, suddenly releases. This enegy tansmitted to the surface of the earth by earthquake waves . 
 The destruction an earthquake causes depends on its magnitude and duration, or the amount of shaking that occurs. A structure's design and the materials used in its also affect the amount of damage the structure incurs.  Earthquakes vary from small,  unnoticeable shaking to large shocks felt over thousands of kilometers. Earthauakes can deform the ground, make buildings and other structures collapse and create tsunamis lange sea waves).  Lives may be lost in the resulting destruction.
 Earthquakes occur at a rate of several hundred per day around the world. A worldwide network of seismographs (machines that record movements of the Earty) detect about 1 million small earthquakes per year. very large earthquakes, such as the 1964 Alaskan earthquake and the 2004  in Aceh Indonesia,  which caused malions of dollars in damage and thousands victims, occur worldwide once every few years .Moderate earthquakes such an the 1989 tremor in California ,USA the 1995 tremor in Kobe Japan, occur about 20 times year. Moderate earthquakes also cause millions of dollars in damage and can harm many people.
In the last 500 years,  several million people have been killed by earthquakes around the world. Worldwide,  earthquakes have also caused severe poperty and structural damage.  Adequate precautions, such as education ,emergency planning, and constructing stronger, more flexible, safely designed structures can limit the loss of life and decrease the damage caused by earthquakes.
seismologists have been monitoring me frequency and locations of earthquakes for most of the 20th century. They generally classify naturally occuring earthquakes into one of two categories: interplate and intraplate. Intraplate earthquakes are the most common ; they occur primarily along plate bounderies. intraplate earthquakes occur where the crust is factuaring whitin a plate. Both interplate and intraplate earthquakes may be caused by tectonic or volcanic forces.
Tectonic earthquakes are caused by the suddeb release of energy stored within the rocks along a fault. The released energy is produced by the strain on the rocks due to movement within the earth, called tectonic deformation. The effect is like the sudden breaking and snapping back of a stretched elastic band
Volcanic earthquakes occur near active volcanoes but have the same fauot slip mechanism as tectonic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes are caused by the upwad movement of magma under the volcano, which strains the rock locally and leads to an earthquake. As the fluid magma rises to the surface of the volcano, it moves and fractures rock masses and causes contious fremors that can past up to several hours of days.

This kinds of earthquake are commonlybase on the factor and geological area where the earthquakes happen. These threekinds of earthquake are tectonic, volcanic and explosion.Tectonic earthquakes are most common one. This kind of earthquake happens whileearth’s crust rocks break because of the geological strength created by moving of theearth’s plates.Volcanic earthquakes happen exactly with volcanic activity. Volcanic earthquakesare when the volcano produces acidic lava, which drys quickly, when it dries quicklyit blocks the top of the volcano. This make no more magma can escape. Pressurestarts to build up and eventually the acidic lava can no longer stand the pressure.So the volcano is free to explode, the pressure is released so fast that an earthquakeis caused. A volcanic earthquake is usually kept within 10-20 miles of the volcano.Explosion earthquakes are the result of the collapse earthquakes that are smallearthquakes occurring in underground mines and caverns.Verbs related to simple present tense and the meaning!!!1. ...                           = ...2. ...                          = ...3. ...                          = ...4. ...                          = ...5. ...                          = ...​</a>

A. Read the following text, and then answer the question below! 
 Earthquakes
Earthquakes - being among the most deadly natural hazards - strike without any prior warning, leaving catastrophe in their wake with terrible loss of human lives as well as economic loss.
Technically, an earthquake (also known as tremor, quake or temblor) is a kind of vibration through the earth’s crust. This vibration occurs as a result of powerful movement of rocks in the earth’s crust. These powerful movements trigger a rapid release of energy that creates seismic waves that travel through the earth. Earthquakes are usually brief, but may repeat over a long period of time. (Earth Science. 2001)
Earthquakes are classified as large and small. Large earthquakes usually begin with slight tremors but rapidly take form of violent shocks. The vibration from a large earthquake last for a few days known as aftershocks. Small earthquake are usually slight tremors and do not cause much damage. Large earthquakes are known to take down building and cause death and injury (Richter, 1935). According to some statistics, there may be an average of 500,000 earthquakes every year but only about 100,000 can be felt and about 100 or so can cause damage each year.
Earthquakes are dreaded by everyone.

                                            Task. 2 Read the text carefully and answer the questions.EarthquakeAn earthquake is sudden shaking of the earth’s surface that often causes a lot ofdamage. It is the result of a sudden release of stored energy in the Earth’s crust that createsseismic waves. Earthquakes may happen naturally or a result of human activities. Smallerearthquakes can also be caused by volcanic activity, landslide, mine blasts and nuclearexperiments.At the Earth’s surface, earthquakes can be seen from the shaking or displacement ofthe ground. Sometimes, they cause tsunamis, which may lead to loss of life and damage ofproperty. There are two types of earthquake that occurs naturally, they are tectonic andvolcanic earthquakes. Tectonic earthquakes are earthquakes that are caused by tectonic plates getting stuckand putting a strain on the ground. The strain becomes so great that rocks give way bybreaking and sliding along fault planes.Volcanic earthquakes are earthquakes which are caused by the movement of magmain volcanoes. In volcanic regions earthquakes may be caused both by tectonic faults and bythe movement of magma in volcanoes. Such earthquakes can be an early warning of volcanicerruptions. The size of an earthquake is usually reported using Richter scale or a related Momentscale. Earthquakes which are 3 on the Richter scale or lower are hard to notice. Whereas,those which are 7 on the Richter scale causes serious damage over large areas.1. How can the earthquake happen?2. How many kinds of earthquake that occur naturally?3.

Seismology studies the frequency, type and size of earthquakes. Earthquakes are measured using observation by seismometers. The magnitude of an earthquakes and its intensity is recorded on a numerical scale known as Richter scale. On this scale, 3 or less is hardly noticeable. Earthquakes with magnitude of more than 6.5 can cause heavy damage.The effects of an earthquake are strongest in the area which near its epicenter. The extent of the earthquakes vibration and further damage to the region is partly dependent on the features of the ground. The worst possible damage occurs in the densely populated areas where structures are not built to withstand intense shaking. Damage and loss of life incurred during earthquake is due to falling buildings and flying glass and objects. In certain areas, an earthquake can cause mudslides that can bury areas under it. Powerful submarine earthquakes cause tsunami or a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean that ripple outward from earthquake epicenter toward coastal areas causing surmountable 	struktur dari teks tersebut</a>

This vibration occurs as a result of powerful movement of rocks in the earth’s crust. These powerful movements trigger a rapid release of energy that creates seismic waves that travel through the earth. Earthquakes are usually brief, but may repeat over a long period of time. (Earth Science.2001) Earthquakes are classified as large and small. Large earthquakes usually begin with slight tremors but rapidly take form of violent shocks. The vibrations from a large earthquake last for a few days known as aftershocks. Small earthquakes usually slight tremors and do not cause much damage. Large earthquakes are known to take down buildings and cause death and injury (Richter,1935).

This kinds of earthquakes are commonly based on the factor and geological are where the earthquakes happen. This three kinds of earthquakes are tectonic, volcanic, and explosion.    Tectonic earthquakes is most common one. This kind of earthquakes happens while's crust rocks break because of the geological strength created by moving of the earth's plates. Volcanic earthquakes happen exactly with volcanic activity. Volcanic earthquakes are when the volcano produced acidic lava which dry quickly, when it drys quickly blocks. The top of the volcano. This make no more magma can escape. Pressure starts to build up and eventualy the addic lava can no longger stand the pressure. So the volcano is free to explode, the plessure is released so fast that an earthquakes is caused.

 Earthquakes
Earthquakes - being among the most deadly natural hazards - strike without any prior warning, leaving catastrophe in their wake with terrible loss of human lives as well as economic loss.
Technically, an earthquake (also known as tremor, quake or temblor) is a kind of vibration through the earth’s crust. This vibration occurs as a result of powerful movement of rocks in the earth’s crust. These powerful movements trigger a rapid release of energy that creates seismic waves that travel through the earth. Earthquakes are usually brief, but may repeat over a long period of time. (Earth Science. 2001)
Earthquakes are classified as large and small. Large earthquakes usually begin with slight tremors but rapidly take form of violent shocks. The vibration from a large earthquake last for a few days known as aftershocks. Small earthquake are usually slight tremors and do not cause much damage. Large earthquakes are known to take down building and cause death and injury (Richter, 1935). According to some statistics, there may be an average of 500,000 earthquakes every year but only about 100,000 can be felt and about 100 or so can cause damage each year.
Earthquakes are dreaded by everyone.

Kinds of Earthquake 
Earthquake often happens around us. It brings great damages. Earthquake is hard to be predicted and that makes lot victims. 
Actually there are three kinds of earthquake. These kinds of earthquake are commonly base on the factor and geological area where the earthquakes happen. These three kinds of earthquake are tectonic, volcanic and explosion.
Tectonic earthquakes is most common one. This kind of earthquake happens while earth’s crust rocks break because of the geological strength created by moving of the earth’s plates.
Volcanic earthquakes happen exactly with volcanic activity. Volcanic earthquakes are when the volcano produces acidic lava, which dries quickly; when it dries quickly it blocks the top of the volcano. This make no more magma can escape. Pressure starts to build up and eventually the acidic lava can no longer stand the pressure. So the volcano is free to explode, the pressure is released so fast that an earthquake is caused. A volcanic earthquake is usually kept within 10-20 miles of the volcano.
Explosion earthquakes are the result of the collapse earthquakes that are small earthquakes occurring in underground mines and caverns.

Seismology studies the frequency, type and size of earthquakes. Earthquakes are measured using observation by seismometers. The magnitude of an earthquakes and its intensity is recorded on a numerical scale known as Richter scale. On this scale, 3 or less is hardly noticeable.

The extent of the earthquakes vibration and further damage to the region is partly dependent on the features of the ground. The worst possible damage occurs in the densely populated areas where structures are not built to withstand intense shaking. Damage and loss of life incurred during earthquake is due to falling buildings and flying glass and objects. In certain areas, an earthquake can cause mudslides that can bury areas under it.

EarthquakesThe Most Deadly Natural HazardsEarthquakes-being among the most deadly natural hazards-strike without any prior warning, leaving catastrophe in their wake terrible loss of human lives as well as economic loss.Technically, an earthquake (also known as tremor, quake or temblor) is a kind of vibration through earth’s crust. This vibration occurs as result of powerful movement of rocks in the earth’s crust. These powerful movements trigger a rapid release of energy that creates seismic waves that travel through the earth. Earthquakes are usually brief, but may repeat over along period of time.(Earth Sience.2001)Earthquakes are classified as large and small. Large earthquakes usually begin with slight tremors but rapidly take form of violent shocks. The vibrations from a large earthquake last for few days known as aftershocks. Small earthquakes are usually slight tremors and do not cause much damage. Large earthquakes are known to take down building and cause death and injury (Richter, 1935)According to some statistics, there may be an average of 500,000 earthquakes every year but only about 100,000 can be felt and about 100 or so can cause damage each year.The study of earthquakes is called seismology. Seismology studies the frequency, type and size of earthquakes. Earthquakes are measured using observation by seismometers. The magnitude of an earthquakes and its intensity is recorded on a numerical scale known as Richter scale. On this scale, 3 or less is hardly noticeable. Earthquakes with magnitude of more than 6.5 can cause heavy damage.The effects of an earthquake are strongest in the area which near its epicenter. The extent of the earthquakes vibration and further damage to the region is partly dependent on the features of the ground. The worst possible damage occurs in the densely populated areas where structures are not built to withstand intense shaking. Damage and loss of life incurred during earthquake is due to falling buildings and flying glass and objects. In certain areas, an earthquake can cause mudslides that can bury areas under it. Powerful submarine earthquakes cause tsunami or a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean that ripple outward from earthquake epicenter toward coastal areas causing surmountable linguistic features dari teks tersebut</h2><br />

                            12. Kinds of earthquake. Earthquake often happens around as. It brings great damages. Earthquake is hard to be predicted and that makes lot victims. Actually there are three kinds of earthquake. This kinds of earthquake are commonly base on the factor and geological area where the eartquakes happen. These three kinds of earthquake are tectonic, volcanic, and explosion. Tectonic eartquakes are most common one. This kind of earthquake happens while earth's crust rocks break because of the geological strength created by moving of the earth's plates. Volcanic earthquakes happen exactly with volcanic activity. Volcanic earthquakes are when the volcano produces acidic lava, which dries quickly ;when it dries quickly it blocks the top of the volcano. This make no more magma can escape. Pressure starts to build up and eventually the acidic lava can no longer stand the pressure. So the volcano is free to explode, the pressure is released so fast that an earthquake is caused. A volcanic earthquake is usually kept within 10-20 miles of the volcano. Explosion earthquakes are the result of the collapse earthquakes that are small earthquakes occuring in underground mines and caverns.   Pertaanyaan.. 1.

                            13. EARTHQUAKES
 Earthquake is the shaking of the Earths surface caused by rapid movement of the earth's rocky outer layer. Earthquakes occur when energy stored within the Earth,  usually in the form of strain in rocks, suddenly releases. This enegy tansmitted to the surface of the earth by earthquake waves . 
 The destruction an earthquake causes depends on its magnitude and duration, or the amount of shaking that occurs. A structure's design and the materials used in its also affect the amount of damage the structure incurs.  Earthquakes vary from small,  unnoticeable shaking to large shocks felt over thousands of kilometers. Earthauakes can deform the ground, make buildings and other structures collapse and create tsunamis lange sea waves).  Lives may be lost in the resulting destruction.
 Earthquakes occur at a rate of several hundred per day around the world. A worldwide network of seismographs (machines that record movements of the Earty) detect about 1 million small earthquakes per year. very large earthquakes, such as the 1964 Alaskan earthquake and the 2004  in Aceh Indonesia,  which caused malions of dollars in damage and thousands victims, occur worldwide once every few years .Moderate earthquakes such an the 1989 tremor in California ,USA the 1995 tremor in Kobe Japan, occur about 20 times year. Moderate earthquakes also cause millions of dollars in damage and can harm many people.
In the last 500 years,  several million people have been killed by earthquakes around the world. Worldwide,  earthquakes have also caused severe poperty and structural damage.  Adequate precautions, such as education ,emergency planning, and constructing stronger, more flexible, safely designed structures can limit the loss of life and decrease the damage caused by earthquakes.
seismologists have been monitoring me frequency and locations of earthquakes for most of the 20th century. They generally classify naturally occuring earthquakes into one of two categories: interplate and intraplate. Intraplate earthquakes are the most common ; they occur primarily along plate bounderies. intraplate earthquakes occur where the crust is factuaring whitin a plate. Both interplate and intraplate earthquakes may be caused by tectonic or volcanic forces.
Tectonic earthquakes are caused by the suddeb release of energy stored within the rocks along a fault. The released energy is produced by the strain on the rocks due to movement within the earth, called tectonic deformation. The effect is like the sudden breaking and snapping back of a stretched elastic band
Volcanic earthquakes occur near active volcanoes but have the same fauot slip mechanism as tectonic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes are caused by the upwad movement of magma under the volcano, which strains the rock locally and leads to an earthquake. As the fluid magma rises to the surface of the volcano, it moves and fractures rock masses and causes contious fremors that can past up to several hours of days.

Earthquake
Earthquake is a natural process that often occurs around us. It can produce a big shock of waves that can destroy anything. The earthquake is also very difficult to be predicted. However, earthquake’s power can be measured using a tool called seismograph. There are two types of earthquakes that categorized by geological factors and the area where the earthquake occurred. Both of types are tectonic and volcanic.
Tectonic earthquakes are one of the most common earthquakes. This occurred when the earth’s crust rocks broken because geological force created by the movement of tectonic plates. This type of earthquakes can cause any damage or natural disaster. Its strong vibrations are capable to spread into other parts of the earth quickly.
The second is volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes occur due to magma activity inside the volcano. If the magma activity is getting higher, it will cause an explosion and earthquake vibrations. Volcanic earthquakes can be felt just around the volcano.
Earthquakes can cause the damage, if the power produced is quite large. The damages include: the buildings, the ground, and even can cause a tsunami.</h2><br />

These plates squeeze and stretchand can sometimes cause the surface of the earth tobreak.The surface of the earth is like a jigsaw puzzle. It'snot just one piece of land, but also about 20 piecesthat are always moving. We don't feel thismovement because the pieces move quite slowly.Each of these pieces is called a tectonic plate.

                            22. EARTHQUAKES
 Earthquake is the shaking of the Earths surface caused by rapid movement of the earth's rocky outer layer. Earthquakes occur when energy stored within the Earth,  usually in the form of strain in rocks, suddenly releases. This enegy tansmitted to the surface of the earth by earthquake waves . 
 The destruction an earthquake causes depends on its magnitude and duration, or the amount of shaking that occurs. A structure's design and the materials used in its also affect the amount of damage the structure incurs.  Earthquakes vary from small,  unnoticeable shaking to large shocks felt over thousands of kilometers. Earthauakes can deform the ground, make buildings and other structures collapse and create tsunamis lange sea waves).  Lives may be lost in the resulting destruction.
 Earthquakes occur at a rate of several hundred per day around the world. A worldwide network of seismographs (machines that record movements of the Earty) detect about 1 million small earthquakes per year. very large earthquakes, such as the 1964 Alaskan earthquake and the 2004  in Aceh Indonesia,  which caused malions of dollars in damage and thousands victims, occur worldwide once every few years .Moderate earthquakes such an the 1989 tremor in California ,USA the 1995 tremor in Kobe Japan, occur about 20 times year. Moderate earthquakes also cause millions of dollars in damage and can harm many people.
In the last 500 years,  several million people have been killed by earthquakes around the world. Worldwide,  earthquakes have also caused severe poperty and structural damage.  Adequate precautions, such as education ,emergency planning, and constructing stronger, more flexible, safely designed structures can limit the loss of life and decrease the damage caused by earthquakes.
seismologists have been monitoring me frequency and locations of earthquakes for most of the 20th century. They generally classify naturally occuring earthquakes into one of two categories: interplate and intraplate. Intraplate earthquakes are the most common ; they occur primarily along plate bounderies. intraplate earthquakes occur where the crust is factuaring whitin a plate. Both interplate and intraplate earthquakes may be caused by tectonic or volcanic forces.
Tectonic earthquakes are caused by the suddeb release of energy stored within the rocks along a fault. The released energy is produced by the strain on the rocks due to movement within the earth, called tectonic deformation. The effect is like the sudden breaking and snapping back of a stretched elastic band
Volcanic earthquakes occur near active volcanoes but have the same fauot slip mechanism as tectonic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes are caused by the upwad movement of magma under the volcano, which strains the rock locally and leads to an earthquake. As the fluid magma rises to the surface of the volcano, it moves and fractures rock masses and causes contious fremors that can past up to several hours of days.

                        GEMPA BUMIGempa adalah gemetar permukaan bumi yang disebabkan oleh gerakan cepat dari lapisan luar berbatu bumi. Gempa bumi terjadi ketika energi yang tersimpan dalam bumi, biasanya dalam bentuk ketegangan dalam batuan, tiba-tiba melepaskan. Energi ini ditransmisikan ke permukaan bumi dengan gelombang gempa.Kehancuran gempa bumi menyebabkan tergantung pada besarnya dan durasi, atau jumlah gemetar yang terjadi. desain Struktur dan bahan yang digunakan dalam perusahaan juga mempengaruhi jumlah kerusakan struktur menimbulkan. Gempa bumi bervariasi dari kecil, gemetar kentara guncangan besar merasa lebih ribuan kilometer. Gempa bumi dapat merusak tanah, membuat bangunan dan struktur lainnya kolaps dan menciptakan gelombang tsunami lange laut). Hidup mungkin akan hilang dalam kehancuran yang dihasilkan.Gempa bumi terjadi pada tingkat beberapa ratus per hari di seluruh dunia. Sebuah jaringan di seluruh dunia seismograf (mesin yang gerakan catatan earty) mendeteksi sekitar 1 juta gempa kecil per tahun. gempa bumi yang sangat besar, seperti tahun 1964 gempa bumi Alaska dan tahun 2004 di Aceh Indonesia, yang menyebabkan malions dolar dalam kerusakan dan ribuan korban, terjadi di seluruh dunia sekali setiap beberapa tahun .Moderate gempa bumi seperti tahun 1989 tremor di California, USA 1995 tremor di Kobe Jepang, terjadi sekitar 20 kali setahun. gempa bumi moderat juga menyebabkan jutaan dolar dalam kerusakan dan dapat membahayakan banyak orang.Dalam 500 tahun terakhir, beberapa juta orang telah dibunuh oleh gempa bumi di seluruh dunia. Di seluruh dunia, gempa bumi juga menyebabkan poperty dan kerusakan struktural. tindakan pencegahan yang memadai, seperti pendidikan, perencanaan darurat, dan membangun kuat, lebih fleksibel, struktur yang dirancang dengan aman dapat membatasi hilangnya nyawa dan mengurangi kerusakan yang disebabkan oleh gempa bumi.seismolog telah memantau saya frekuensi dan lokasi gempa untuk sebagian besar abad ke-20. Mereka umumnya mengklasifikasikan terjadi secara alami gempa bumi menjadi salah satu dari dua kategori: interplate dan intraplate. gempa intraplate adalah yang paling umum; mereka terjadi terutama di sepanjang bounderies piring. gempa intraplate terjadi di mana kerak factuaring whitin piring. Kedua interplate dan gempa bumi intraplate dapat disebabkan oleh kekuatan tektonik atau vulkanik.gempa bumi tektonik disebabkan oleh pelepasan suddeb energi yang tersimpan dalam batuan di sepanjang kesalahan. energi yang dilepaskan dihasilkan oleh strain di bebatuan karena gerakan dalam bumi, disebut deformasi tektonik.

This kinds of earthquake are commonlybase on the factor and geological area where the earthquakes happen. These threekinds of earthquake are tectonic, volcanic and explosion.Tectonic earthquakes are most common one. This kind of earthquake happens whileearth’s crust rocks break because of the geological strength created by moving of theearth’s plates.Volcanic earthquakes happen exactly with volcanic activity. Volcanic earthquakesare when the volcano produces acidic lava, which drys quickly, when it dries quicklyit blocks the top of the volcano. This make no more magma can escape. Pressurestarts to build up and eventually the acidic lava can no longer stand the pressure.So the volcano is free to explode, the pressure is released so fast that an earthquakeis caused. A volcanic earthquake is usually kept within 10-20 miles of the volcano.Explosion earthquakes are the result of the collapse earthquakes that are smallearthquakes occurring in underground mines and caverns.Verbs related to simple present tense and the meaning!!!1. ...                           = ...2. ...                          = ...3. ...                          = ...4. ...                          = ...5. ...                          = ...​</h2><br />

A. Read the following text, and then answer the question below! 
 Earthquakes
Earthquakes - being among the most deadly natural hazards - strike without any prior warning, leaving catastrophe in their wake with terrible loss of human lives as well as economic loss.
Technically, an earthquake (also known as tremor, quake or temblor) is a kind of vibration through the earth’s crust. This vibration occurs as a result of powerful movement of rocks in the earth’s crust. These powerful movements trigger a rapid release of energy that creates seismic waves that travel through the earth. Earthquakes are usually brief, but may repeat over a long period of time. (Earth Science. 2001)
Earthquakes are classified as large and small. Large earthquakes usually begin with slight tremors but rapidly take form of violent shocks. The vibration from a large earthquake last for a few days known as aftershocks. Small earthquake are usually slight tremors and do not cause much damage. Large earthquakes are known to take down building and cause death and injury (Richter, 1935). According to some statistics, there may be an average of 500,000 earthquakes every year but only about 100,000 can be felt and about 100 or so can cause damage each year.
Earthquakes are dreaded by everyone.

                            32. Task. 2 Read the text carefully and answer the questions.EarthquakeAn earthquake is sudden shaking of the earth’s surface that often causes a lot ofdamage. It is the result of a sudden release of stored energy in the Earth’s crust that createsseismic waves. Earthquakes may happen naturally or a result of human activities. Smallerearthquakes can also be caused by volcanic activity, landslide, mine blasts and nuclearexperiments.At the Earth’s surface, earthquakes can be seen from the shaking or displacement ofthe ground. Sometimes, they cause tsunamis, which may lead to loss of life and damage ofproperty. There are two types of earthquake that occurs naturally, they are tectonic andvolcanic earthquakes. Tectonic earthquakes are earthquakes that are caused by tectonic plates getting stuckand putting a strain on the ground. The strain becomes so great that rocks give way bybreaking and sliding along fault planes.Volcanic earthquakes are earthquakes which are caused by the movement of magmain volcanoes. In volcanic regions earthquakes may be caused both by tectonic faults and bythe movement of magma in volcanoes. Such earthquakes can be an early warning of volcanicerruptions. The size of an earthquake is usually reported using Richter scale or a related Momentscale. Earthquakes which are 3 on the Richter scale or lower are hard to notice. Whereas,those which are 7 on the Richter scale causes serious damage over large areas.1. How can the earthquake happen?2. How many kinds of earthquake that occur naturally?3.

Large earthquakes are known to take down building and cause death and injury (Richter, 1935)According to some statistics, there may be an average of 500,000 earthquakes every year but only about 100,000 can be felt and about 100 or so can cause damage each year.The study of earthquakes is called seismology. Seismology studies the frequency, type and size of earthquakes. Earthquakes are measured using observation by seismometers. The magnitude of an earthquakes and its intensity is recorded on a numerical scale known as Richter scale. On this scale, 3 or less is hardly noticeable. Earthquakes with magnitude of more than 6.5 can cause heavy damage.The effects of an earthquake are strongest in the area which near its epicenter. The extent of the earthquakes vibration and further damage to the region is partly dependent on the features of the ground. The worst possible damage occurs in the densely populated areas where structures are not built to withstand intense shaking. Damage and loss of life incurred during earthquake is due to falling buildings and flying glass and objects. In certain areas, an earthquake can cause mudslides that can bury areas under it. Powerful submarine earthquakes cause tsunami or a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean that ripple outward from earthquake epicenter toward coastal areas causing surmountable 	struktur dari teks tersebut</h2><br />

                            39. Read and answer the question based on the following text!Earthquakes – being among the most deadly natural hazards – strike without any prior warning, leaving catastrophe in their wake with terrible loss of human lives as well as economic loss.Technically, an earthquake (also known as tremor, quake or temblor) is a kind of vibration through the earth’s crust. This vibration occurs as a result of powerful movement of rocks in the earth’s crust. These powerful movements trigger a rapid release of energy that creates seismic waves that travel through the earth. Earthquakes are usually brief, but may repeat over a long period of time. (Earth Science.2001) Earthquakes are classified as large and small. Large earthquakes usually begin with slight tremors but rapidly take form of violent shocks. The vibrations from a large earthquake last for a few days known as aftershocks. Small earthquakes usually slight tremors and do not cause much damage.
